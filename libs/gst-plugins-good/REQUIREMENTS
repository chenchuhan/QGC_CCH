GStreamer uses a *large* array of tools and libraries, most of which are
optional. We have attempted to make sure that any code that depends on
optional libraries doesn't get built unless you have those libraries. If
you find this not to be the case, please, let us know by filing a bug
report at http://bugzilla.gnome.org/.

On Debian/Ubuntu, the easiest way to install most build requirements is:

        sudo apt-get build-dep gst-plugins-good1.0

Required tools:
===============

An extra set of tools is required if you wish to build GStreamer
from git (using autogen.sh):

autoconf  >= 2.68   https://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/
automake  >= 1.11   https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/
gettext   >= 0.17   https://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
libtool   >= 2.2.6  https://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/
pkgconfig >= 0.9.0  https://www.freedesktop.org/software/pkgconfig/

Required libraries:
===================

Package:        GStreamer
Version:        1.x (same 1.x version as this package)
Recommended:    Latest 1.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:  libgstreamer1.0-dev
Notes:          The required version is updated frequently, so the version
                listed in this file is often out of date. If you are compiling
                from git master, you will usually need GStreamer core and
                gst-plugins-base from git master as well.

Package:        GStreamer Base Plugins
Version:        1.x (same 1.x version as this package)
Recommended:    Latest 1.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/
DebianPackage:  libgstreamer-plugins-base1.0-dev
Notes:          The required version is updated frequently, so the version
                listed in this file is often out of date. If you are compiling
                from git master, you will usually need GStreamer core and
                gst-plugins-base from git master as well.


Optional libraries:
===================

This file lists supporting libraries for which gst-plugins-good contains
plugins, as well as their minimum required version. You can find the
corresponding plugins in ext/(library)

Package:        Orc
Version:        >= 0.4.17
Recommended:    Latest 0.4.x
URL:            http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/data/src/orc/
DebianPackage:  liborc-0.4-dev
Notes:		Used by many plugins for accelerating SIMD processing using
                run-time generated assembly. Not a hard requirement, but
                highly recommended. Packagers, please hard-depend on liborc.
                The git repository is http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/orc/
                (all versions on entropywave.com are outdated)

Package:        gdk-pixbuf Library

                will work just fine without it. gudev is only required for
                the device probing and monitoring functionality to detect
