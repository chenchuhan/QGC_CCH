* MPEG4 header
  - ffmpeg mpeg4 decoder gives error message when sending only the config
    string, parsing is OK, error just means no picture was found in the
    stream.

* compare H263 encoders and H263+

* better RTP packetizing for h263

* bitrate tuning in ffmpeg
  - fixed the qmax values so we can quantize more.

* make ffmpeg negotiate only with accepted framerates
