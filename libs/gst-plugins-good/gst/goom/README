The Goom plugin is based on the Goom visualization code from
the Goom homepage found at: 
http://ios.free.fr/?page=projet&quoi=1 

Like the original library so is the Goom plugin available under the LGPL license

This is based on goom2k4 with changes to plugin_info.c and mmx.h to use Orc for CPU
detection and GStreamer-specific ifdef's for architecture detection.

These files are not in use right now:
filters_mmx.s
goomsl*
surf3d.s
