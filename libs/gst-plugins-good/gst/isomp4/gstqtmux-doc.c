/**
 * SECTION:element-mp4mux
 * @title: mp4mux
 * @short_description: Muxer for ISO MPEG-4 (.mp4) files
 *
 * This element merges streams (audio and video) into ISO MPEG-4 (.mp4) files.
 *
 * The following background intends to explain why various similar muxers
 * are present in this plugin.
 *
 * The [QuickTime file format specification](http://www.apple.com/quicktime/resources/qtfileformat.pdf)
 * served as basis for the MP4 file format specification (mp4mux), and as such
 * the QuickTime file structure is nearly identical to the so-called ISO Base
 * Media file format defined in ISO 14496-12 (except for some media specific
 * parts).
 *
 * In turn, the latter ISO Base Media format was further specialized as a
 * Motion JPEG-2000 file format in ISO 15444-3 (mj2mux)
 * and in various 3GPP(2) specs (3gppmux).
 * The fragmented file features defined (only) in ISO Base Media are used by
 * ISMV files making up (a.o.) Smooth Streaming (ismlmux).
 *
 * A few properties (#GstMP4Mux:movie-timescale, #GstMP4Mux:trak-timescale)
 * allow adjusting some technical parameters, which might be useful in (rare)
 * cases to resolve compatibility issues in some situations.
 *
 * Some other properties influence the result more fundamentally.
 * A typical mov/mp4 file's metadata (aka moov) is located at the end of the
 * file, somewhat contrary to this usually being called "the header".
 * However, a #GstMP4Mux:faststart file will (with some effort) arrange this to
 * be located near start of the file, which then allows it e.g. to be played
 * while downloading. Alternatively, rather than having one chunk of metadata at
 * start (or end), there can be some metadata at start and most of the other
 * data can be spread out into fragments of #GstMP4Mux:fragment-duration.
 * If such fragmented layout is intended for streaming purposes, then
 * #GstMP4Mux:streamable allows foregoing to add index metadata (at the end of
 * file).
 *
 * ## Example pipelines
 * |[
 * gst-launch-1.0 gst-launch-1.0 v4l2src num-buffers=50 ! queue ! x264enc ! mp4mux ! filesink location=video.mp4
 * ]|
 * Records a video stream captured from a v4l2 device, encodes it into H.264
 * and muxes it into an mp4 file.
